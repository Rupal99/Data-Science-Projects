Developed a logistic regression model for an Education company to help them identify the potential hot leads so, that the sales team can focus more on them instead of calling everyone.

The dataset contains the 9240 data points present  with 37 column attributes/features from the past.  This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. 

 
## Observations/Outcomes

In this project, we found various insights by performing several different tasks on the dataset. 
The variables that mattered the most in the potential buyers are :-

- The total time spend on the Website.

- Total number of visits. 

- When their current occupation is as a working professional keeping these in mind the X Education can flourish as they have a very high chance to get almost all the potential buyers to change their mind and buy their courses.
