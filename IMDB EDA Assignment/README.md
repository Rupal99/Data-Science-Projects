# IMDb Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset contains the data of 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this assignment, we tried finding some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.

The dataset contains the 100 best performing movies with 62 column attributes/features from the year 2010 to 2016. 

 
## Observations/Outcomes

In this project we found various insights by performing several different tasks on the dataset. They are: 

- In general, age group of under 18 and above 45 watched less movies irrespective of their gender or they watched but didn't vote.

- There is not much difference in votes among Action, Thriller, Adventure  which implies these three genre, goes hand in hand. 

- Top 1000 voters voted most for Sci-Fi movies. 

- Romance movies are given the least vote.

- Although the number of votes for Romance genre is less by male as compared to female, but it is rated well (almost similar) by both the genders.

- Both USA and non-USA people have rated USA movies more as compare to non-USA movies 

- The Adventure genre has recieved the highest rating from the female audience across age groups. 

- And many more.
