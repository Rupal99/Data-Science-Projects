# Advance Regression Housing Assignment 

Developed a Regression model for a US-based housing company to help them to predict the actual value of the prospective properties so that they can purchase the properties at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 

## Dataset Information

Please refer the [csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8fgDsCuSlryv1qCcH9AGgKJxlX4sG-y/view?usp=sharing) and [txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u1CbJvCDptr9Pqd9YN4ThxuKpgODIOC6/view?usp=sharing) files provided above for the dataset and its information.
The dataset contains 1460 rows and 81 predictor features for the target variable SalePrice. 

 
## Observations/Outcomes

Developed a Lasso Regression model with r2 score of 93.25 % in train and 88.52 % in test datasets. 

The most important features which affects the housing price are: 

-  The low density residential zones that are intended to create, maintain, and promote neighborhoods with larger lot sizes where the land use is primarily single-family dwellings. 

- Above Grade Square Feet I.e all living square feet in a home that is above the ground. It does not include basements 

- Total square feet of basement area 

- The overall material and finish of the house 

- Overall condition of the house
